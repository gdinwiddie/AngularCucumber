# Angular and Protractor and Cucumber, Oh My!

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of Angular, Protractor, and Cucumber together, deciding how I prefer to use them.
It started with a plain Angular generated project (`ng new zip`) and I've explored from there.
Perhaps this will help you jumpstart your use of Cucumber with Angular.
Or, perhaps you'll notice I'm doing something dumb and let me know.
Either outcome is a help to someone. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
